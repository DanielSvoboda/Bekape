Bekape is a Windows Forms application that allows users to back up their files to a local drive. It uses the MD5 hash function to verify the integrity of the backup files.

•DOWNLOAD: https://github.com/DanielSvoboda/Bekape/raw/main/Bekape.exe

To use Bekape, you first need to place the Bekape.exe program on a mobile device, such as a pendrive or external hard drive, it must be on the same drive as the backup. After the program, add the folders you want to back up to the folder list. You can do this by clicking the “Add Folder” button and selecting the folders you want to back up.

After adding the folders you want to back up, the backup process will start automatically, if while using the program you added or modified any information, use the "Synchronize" button. Bekape will compare the MD5 hashes of files in the source folders and backup folders. If the hashes are different, Bekape will copy the file from the source folder to the backup folder.

The next time you open the program, it will synchronize automatically after opening, the only action necessary is if you want to add new folders.

Bekape also has a console that you can use to view what new files and modified files are. To view the console, click the "Log" button.
